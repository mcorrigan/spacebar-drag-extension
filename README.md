This is a quickly built extension for Chrome, Brave, Edge, and other chrome extension supporting browsers. 

### Why This?
Several times now I've found myself wishing I had another way to navigate large images and media in my web 
browser as well as finely control scrolling on web pages. To solve this, I created an browser extension. The 
extension simply activates by use of the spacebar, and then allows you to use your mouse to drag anyway the 
page can already scroll. (Similar to Photoshop if you are familiar).

Additional settings allow for choosing which mouse button should do the work, whether to use motion velocities, colors 
and styles, and other minor tweaks. 

### Where to Get It
It is published on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jaccokbdifidliancbiinoccfpilkiea/)

#### Bugs
Please report bugs and issues here. This is a passive project for fun, so most requests will be second priority to my income generating
life :)
